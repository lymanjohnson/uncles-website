 <BR>
I have just visited your site - drawn there by your reference to William Angell (1560c-1629) - father of James and Mary.<BR>
 <BR>
You list William as married to Anne Sanson - William is included in various Herald's Visitations where he is listed as the husband of Joan Povey (1565-1608).  William's brother Thomas (1570-1624) is also mentioned in Herald's Visitations and his wife is listed as Anne Sanson/Sansom.<BR>
 <BR>
William was alive by 1566 when he was mentioned in his grandfather's will (Robert Angell d.1566).  Although I have not found the exact marriage details with Joan Povey there are numerous business dealings with her family which are documented and the Angells were still quartering their Arms with those of Povey as late as 1784.  William had gone to London and made his fortune as a member of the Fishmonger's company.  He had a large brood of kids who made it to adulthood including the two you mention James and Mary.  James was mentioned in William's will as his second son (John 1592-1670 was the eldest) and was probably born about 1600 as he gained his freedom of the Fishmonger's Company in 1622 (the normal age for this was about 21) and as was the norm married shortly after this 2 February 1623/24 Anne Elliott.  This puts the Thomas Angell (born 1618) outside this marriage, however James did have another Thomas (1635-1638) who was the prime heir in James will of 1638, alas young Thomas died within a few months of his father.  <BR>
 <BR>
You also mention Mary Angell - James sister.  Her eldest son John Claypole married Oliver Cromwell's daughter Elizabeth and other sons made their way to the New World in the later 17th Century as a result of their friendship with William Penn.<BR>
 <BR>
There is another sister Catherine Angell who does have positive links with the Rhode Island Colony.  She married John Pemberton whose Aunt Alice Pemberton was the mother of Dr. Roger Williams.<BR>
 <BR>
I hope this information is of some use - for interest I have attached a picture of the house William Angell purchased in 1614 at Crowhurst in Surrey.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C78">78</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
