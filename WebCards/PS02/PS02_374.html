Dating from 1641, the Wing Fort House in East Sandwich stands as the oldest house in New England continuously inhabited by members of one family -- in this case, for three centuries. Built by Quaker Stephen Wing, one of the Cape's first settlers, this house started out as a one-room homestead with a loft, similar to those the Pilgrims built Constructed with double walls, the &quot;fort&quot; was secured against Indian attacks, which never came from the friendly natives<BR>
<BR>
Stephen's grandson and namesake built his own saltbox next to the Fort House The two homes were combined during the lath century, with each home losing its original chimney and gaining the peaked roof that blanketed both dwellings In the attic, however, the rakers from the Fort House's original peaked roof can be seen, now incorporated into one of the house's gables.<BR>
<BR>
All 12 rooms are filled with Wing furniture and antiques.<BR>
<BR>
Located on Spring Hill Road, near Route 6A in East Sandwich, the Wing Fort House is open 10 a m to 4 p m ., Monday--Friday Tours given by caretakers<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C275">275</A></SUP><BR>
