Thomas Wheeler came to Ameirca with the Rev. John Jones' Company in the ship Defiance, which landed in New England 3 October 1635, for, with his wife, children, and most probably some grandchildren, he was in Concord as early as 17 April 1636/1637, when he was made freeman there. Of his life in Concord, substantially nothing is known. Being a supporter of the Rev. John Jones at the time of the dissension in the Church at Concord, he became one of those who removed with him to Fairfield in 1644, settling at Pequonnock, on Uncoway Brook, where his home lot of 2.5 acres is recorded, January 1649. This was at Black Rock. His will was dated 16 January 1653/1654, and proved 23 August 1654, mentions his wife Ann. To his eldest son Thomas he gave all of his property in Concord. He also mentions his daughter Sarah Sherwood and her son Thomas Sherwood; and his grandchildren Mary, James, Thomas and John Bennit. His son John was made executor and was to received the estate in Fairfield.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C546">546, p200</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
