Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">William, along with his brother John and sister Margeret (Margerie), sailed overseas from England to America. The exact port from which they sailed is unknown, however, history had him as residing in Bedenhall, Essex County, England, prior to the sailing. Though their exact arrival date and port cannot be found, there is in the archives of Conneticut a will of Adam Beebe who died aboard an unknamed ship to America; this will, evidently written while sailing has the signatures of William and John Partridge as witnesses. These signatures match those found in the record's of Medfield, MA.<BR>
<BR>
William received land in Medfield, MA, where in the spring of 1651 he was granted six acres for a house-lot on North Street (otherwise known as Bachelor's Row). Evidently he did not build his home until 1653 when he took the freeman's oath, and settled the town.<BR>
<BR>
In the annual town meeting of Medfield, year 1655, William was one of three men chosen to &quot;burn the woods&quot;: an old Indian practice in which the bushes and small trees in the outermost sections of town were set ablaze in a controlled fire to clear the common pastures for &quot;herd-walks.&quot;<BR>
William was selectman in the years 1666 and 1678. In the year 1675 he subscribed to the &quot;new brick college,&quot; and was listed as a proprietor of Medfield, MA.<BR>
<BR>
In his will William gave 1/2 his estate to his wife Sarah, and the remainder to his sons John and William. John died in 1719, without a family, so his part of the estate was divided among the other six children. The property soon passed out of the family name.<BR>
<BR>
His will is on record at the Suffolk County Probate Court (1686-1692)<BR>
