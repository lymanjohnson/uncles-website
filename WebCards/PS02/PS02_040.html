I will and my mind is that, my debts being paid and funeral expenses discharged, all the residue of my goods and chattels shall be divided into three equal parts; one third part whereof I give and bequeath unto my loving wife Alice for her part and portion therein, according to the custom of the city of London. And, for that my son Sydrack and my daughter Catherine, now the wife of Ralph Wightman, citizen and merchant taylor of London, have &quot;binn&quot; by me already preferred and each of them hath received a sufficient portion of my estate, therefore I will that neither of them shall claim or have any customary part or portion of that estate whereof I shall be possessed at the time of my decease. And yet, nevertheless, my will and meaning is that my sons Roger and Robert Williams shall have but one moiety or half part of the other third part of my estate equally between them to be divided, and the other moiety thereof to remain to such other child or children as I shall have living at the time of my decease. The other third part of my estate, which is in my power to dispose, I give and bequeath as followeth, vizt. to my son Sydrack twenty and five pounds and to my said daughter Catherine Wightman twenty five pounds, to be paid to each of them severally within one year next after my decease, and to my said sons Robert and Roger Williams twenty and five pounds apiece, to be paid unto each of them severally at his age of four and twenty years. To my godson James Wightman, son of the beforenamed Katherine Wightman my daughter, five pounds in money, to be paid unto his father for the use of his said son. To Eliabeth Pemberton, Ellen Woolley and Elizabeth Bryan, my god daughters, to every of them twenty shillings apiece, to be paid to their several parents or governors, &amp;c. To Thomas Nicholson, citizen and currier of London, ten shillings, to Elizabeth Kinge, wife of Robert Kinge, clothworker, twenty shillings and to my kinswoman Alice Harris, now dwelling with me, forty shillings. To Robert Parke, my &quot;Jemmall&quot; ring and to Edward Waterhouse my dagger, knife, chain and girdle. To the poor of St. Sepulchres without Newgate, London, wherein I now dwell, ten pounds in money and bread to be distributed amongst them on the day of my funeral or the day after, as follows, vizt. to the poor in Smithfield quarter thirty five shillings in money and thirty five shillings in bread, to the poor in Holborn Cross quarter twenty shillings in money and fifteen shillings in bread, and to the poor in old bayley quarter thirty shillings in money and thirty shillings in bread. To the poor of the said parish without Smithfield Bars twenty shillings in bread. To Alice and Roger Bryan, children of Henry Bryan, coachmaker, ten shillings apiece. The residue to my wife Alice Williams whom I do make and appoint sole executrix of this my last will. And overseers thereof I do make and appoint my brother in law Roger Pemberton, my said son in law Ralph Wightman, my kinsman, Thomas Morse and the said Robert Kinge, to whom twenty shillings apiece.
