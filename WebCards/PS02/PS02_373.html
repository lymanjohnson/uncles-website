Robert, 3, and two serv. in co. with his br. Robert. They were prob. from Great Baddow, near Chelmsford in Co. Essex. He perhaps. had gr. of ld. 1637; was not, we may safely judge, one of the first four sett. of Martha's Vineyard, as by doubtf. Tradit. report. d. a. 1639. His wid. Margaret wh. unit. with the ch. 1639, had come with his s. John prob. in a later sh. d. 1644, and in her will of 1 Sept. in that yr. ment. br. Robert, and s. Robert. JOHN, Salem, s. of the preced. by w.

He was of ar. co. 1661, freem. 1668, was a capt. and with many neighb. obt. gr. of ld. at Springfield a. 1681, that part wh. bec.

John, and Lucy, perhaps his w. are ment. by Felt, II. 578, as favarers of Gorton in 1644. To this John belongs the earlier Distinct. for a worse heresy, as the Court's orde in Nov. 1636, proves, &quot;that he shall be whipt, and bound to his good behav. for strik, his mo.

John immigrated from Ipswitch to Salem, New England in 1634. John Pease appears to have been a favorite of his grandmother Margaret Pease, as shown by her will which was brought into court soon after action was taken in the settlement of his father's estate. It seems probable that he may have been adopted by his grandmother before his fathers death. She doubtless had full authority for placing him in the care of Thomas Watson, to dispose of him as his own child, rendering it unnecessary for the court to take any action on his custody, as in the case of his older brother. John was a yoeman when he settled in that part of Salem called &quot;Northfields&quot;. His name was mentioned frequently in the Essex county and Salem Town records as grantee and grantor of deeds, as a witness, as an overseer of wills, as a constable, and etc. He was made a freeman 29 April 1668 and took the oath before the County court 30 June 1668. He was called &quot;Captain&quot; John Pease. He joined the First Church at Salem on 4 July 1667. It is believed that he, with his two oldest sons John and Robert, went to what is now called Enfield in 1679, living the first winter in an excavation in the side of a hill about 40 rods from where the first meetinghouse stood On 23 July 1680 John and his two eldest sons had land granted to them. He sold his property in Salem in 1682. When they moved to Fresh Water Brook it was still a part of Springfield, Mass., in 1681 Enfield was established and became a part of Connecticut. The area is about 2.5 miles east of what is now called Thompsonville, CT. He sickened while making preparations for building, and died suddenly. This was 10 days after his wife died and the day before one of his daughters died. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
