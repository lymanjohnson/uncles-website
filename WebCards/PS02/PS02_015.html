He spent eighteen years in Holland-Flushing, the Hague and elsewhere. He was the one-time preacher to the company of Merchant Adventures in Holland; to Sophia, Prince of the Palatine, and to Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia and daughter of King James I.<BR>
<BR>
Rev. John Wing died in England the summer of 1630 in his 46th year. In his will he mentioned he was late of the Hague, now living in St. Mary Aldermary, London, November 2, 1629. He said his daughter Deborah, age 19 was recently married.<BR>
<BR>
Rev. John preached in Hanover, Germany. He was also in charge of a congregation at the old Roman Cinque, part of Sandwich in Kent at some period prior to 1620. He removed to the Hague in 1627, but before that time he was living in Hamburg, Germany.<BR>
<BR>
On June 19, 1620, he was ordained under the direction of Mr. John Paget of Amsterdam. Rev. John was the first English pastor at the Hague being admitted May 11, 1627. That church was used by the Royal family.<BR>
<BR>
John and Deborah spent fifteen years in Germany and Holland as practical exiles from their native England. His salary was 500 pounds a year which afforded them the means of living in an affluent society. Today this amount would total over $10,000.00.<BR>
<BR>
Rev. John went to Oxford College at the age of fifteen. John Wynde of Oxford, Pleb. St. Alban Hall, Oct. 15, 1599, age 14 and on Feb. 12, 1906 Queens College invested him with the degree of Bachelor of Arts.<BR>
<BR>
After spending eighteen years in Holland, he returned to London to accompany his family to America but fell sick and died in 1630. (Rev. Conway thought that Rev. John went to the states with his family ) We now know this is incorrect. Rev. John was author of several books which can be found at the Library of the British Museum and at Boston Public Library.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C275">275</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
He resided in Sandwich England then at Hambury. Removed to Flushing, Zealand where he was pastor of the Puritan Church. He then resided at the Hague where he died ca. 1629. His wife, Deborah came to Lynn, Mass, in 1632 with her sons Daniel, John and Stephen, leaving son Matthew in England [POM]. Her father Rev. Stephen Bachiler came with her [M&amp;N].<BR>
<BR>
Rev. John, son of Matthew Wing, was a non-conformist preacher in the island of Walcheron, in Flushing, provice of Zealand, Holland, and in London. He matriculated at Oxford University, England, was well educated and the author of several printed books, which are still estant, a bound book of Sermons delivered by John Wing in Hamburg, printed at Flushing, Holland, in 1621, is owned by George Wing Sisson. He was born in England and died in London in 1630. He married Deborah, daughter of Rev. Stephen Batchelder. He had sons John, Matthew, Stephen, and Daniel [NNY].<BR>

Thomas Prence adds, &quot;This Wing was pastor of the English Puritan Church at Meddleborough in Zeeland, whose widow brought her children to Sandwich in New England, who afterwards turned Quackers, and from which the Wings of Sandwich, Wareham, Rochester and Dartmouth are derived.&quot; <BR>

Deborah Wing, her four sons, her father, Rev. Stephen Bachiler and wife Helen, Sister Ann Samborn, widow, and her three children lived a life of luxury affording education and social advantages left England for a life of rude huts and wilderness in New England. They sailed on the William and Francis.<BR>
<BR>
They arrived in Boston Harbor, Thursday, June 5, 1632 but moved on to Saugus, Mass. The following Sunday, June 8, Rev. Bachiler began the formation of a church.<BR>
<BR>
Because there were no roads at this time the six miles they traveled to attend church and return home again were trails through woods or by taking a small boat across the bay.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of five years in Saugus, Mass., our ancestor, Deborah Wing and her four sons trekked to Sawne, the oldest town on the Cape. Sawne later became known as Sandwich. Sandwich was the name of their hometown in England.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly thereafter, Matthew returned to England where he took a wife. They and their only son died young leaving no progeny.<BR>
<BR>
From John, Daniel and Stephen have descended the three lines of the family in America. When Deborah took her sons to Sandwich, John was twenty-six, Daniel, twenty-two, Stephen, eighteen and Matthew was the youngest.<BR>
<BR>
They have been characterized as follows: John was the fearless practical pioneer. Daniel, the idealist and religionist; Stephen, the bachelor and man of affairs. The two latter helped to establish the first Friend's (Quaker) Meeting in America and it is claimed that this occurred on Daniel's farm. Both rest today in the little burying ground in the shadow of the time-worn Spring Hill Meeting House. This is where, until recent years, many of their descendants gathered on the first and fifth day.<BR>
<BR>
John never joined up with the Friends. He moved down the Cape to what is now the town of Brewster, possibly to get away from them. Today a stone that was dedicated in 1910 marks the spot of his old home on Wing Island which is really not an island at all. The inscription on the stone reads in part, &quot;In 1656 near this spot, John Wing erected the first house and became the first settler within the limits of old Harwich. Here he died in 1699. He owned land across the Cape from Sea-to-Sea.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Quakers of that day had a harried time indeed, and it is said that members of the family worshipped God their own way in secluded dells in the forest and behind barred doors in their own homes and walked the streets of Sandwich Town when no man or woman dared give anyone the time of day without being subjected to fine and punishment. Both Daniel and Stephen being true to their convictions were often called before the Court of Plymouth for &quot;sundrie miscarriage of conduct&quot; and forced to pay exorbitant fines.<BR>
<BR>
Large families were the vogue of the day and the grandchildren of the three brothers - John, Daniel and Stephen were many. Looking over early records of Sandwich and nearby towns, we find the name of Wing often recorded indicating that they were men of affairs more than the ordinary run of the Colonists. Many of their homesteads are still standing, some of them still in the hands of the family. In fact it has been said that no New England family of the present generation is richer in the possession of rare old Colonial houses than are the Wings. Notable is the Old Fort House at Sandwich, the home where the late Alvin P. Wing was born and died. The central part of this house was originally a fort or block house built in the first days of settlement. It is probably that Stephen purchased it from the town remodeling and adding to it. Here he lived until the end of his life It has been said it is the oldest dwelling house in New England. There is also the old Isaac Wing House at Scarton Neck which boasts the largest fireplace in all New England.<BR>
<BR>
Gradually, one generation or the next of these early Wings ventured away from the Cape. Lack of space alone forbids giving the details of those early groups that went west to New York state, especially Duchess County where they founded the Oblong, Wings Falls which later became Glen Falls. The name changed when it was sold to a man by the name of Glen. Space does not permit relating the interesting exodus of those Loyalists Wings, led by Gershom Wing, into Ontario at a later date and something of our Canadian cousins. &lt;P&gt;Today this old time blue-blooded Yankee race is found in every city and almost every hamlet  in America. There are no less than one hundred thousand lineal descendants of Mother Deborah and probably one half live east, the other half west of the Hudson River.<BR>
<BR>
One hundred of Deborah's grandsons carried flint-locks in the Revolution and at least five hundred bore arms in the War of the Rebellion. Interesting to note that it was twenty-two year old Stephen, son of the pioneer Stephen, who was the first of the family to lose his life for his country. He was killed in King Phillips War in 1675.<BR>
<BR>
The eldest son of the original Stephen -- Nathaniel settled in Pocasset, a part of Falmouth, Mass. His holdings were so momentous that today the land is still known as Wing's Neck.<BR>
<BR>
A grandson, Simon, was born in 1722 and with his seven sons immigrated to New Sandwich and later Wayne, ME between 1775-1780. They settled around a pond called Pocasset. As the brothers died, they were placed head to head forming a circle with a monument in the center. Just outside and forming another circle lie the next generation and another circle, etc.<BR>
<BR>
At this point, it will be suffice to remind the reader of the almost forgotten Asa Sylvester Wing. He was the greatest of all the abolitionists to whom the slaves with their small savings erected a monument in 1852 and of Simon W. Wing the first socialist candidate for the President of the United States.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
