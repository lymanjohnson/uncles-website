He took oath of allegience to Carles II. 31 May 1666, at Providence and eight years later was obliged to go to England to secure the interpos. of the crown as to the land controversy for which see the k.'s response to Govenor Winthrop in Conn. Col. Rec. II. 586, returned soon after the outbreak of Philip's war to Providence; there staid through the war of 1675; in 1678, having made his will, 4 Dec. in his 68th year as he says, he went for home to support the cause of Pautuxet props. emb. at Boston in the Unity, Capt. Condy, but on 24 Jan. 1679, was taken by an Algerine corsair, and sold in Barbary. After more than a year's slavery, he was redeemed at a high rate; Connecticut for which Colony he had be engaged in some agency paying 400 Pounds, in part of it, as Judge Staples assures me, travelled through Spain and France, and reached London in 1680, and died at the home of his friend, John Stokes, in three days.  The will of 4 Dec. 1678, was proved 20 Feb 1682. His widow Susanna was not perhaps the mother of his ch. Andrew, born 1634 or 5, before mentioned; Mary, who married 1663, Thomas Burden; Howlong, who became second or third wife of Arthur Fenner in Dec. 1684, died without children; and Toleration, 1645.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C197">197, v2p365</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
