Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">As a boy he attracted the attention of the daughters of Sir Christopher Wray, the Lord chief Justice, and they were his early patrons and sent him to Cambridge, where he, apparently, took his B.A. at Christ's College in 1594/5, and certainly his M.A. in 1598. He returned to Epworth, and in 1598 published an edition of Terence, with an English translation: &quot;Terence as achieved by opera ac industria Richard Bernardi in Axholmensi Insula, Lincolnsherii&quot;. On 10 June 1601 he was presented to the living of Worksop by Richard Whalley, and several of his books were written there, among them &quot;Christian Adberisements and Counsels of Peace&quot; and &quot;Disuasions from Separatists Schisme, commonly called Brownisme&quot;, London 1608. After having drawn near complete Separation he changed his view and opposed them, entering in a controversy with Ainsworth. He published his &quot;Plain Evidences the Church of England Apostolicall, Separation Schismaticall&quot;. His best work was &quot;The Faithful Shepherd&quot;, 1607. While vicar of Worksop, he exorcised one John Fox, a possessed (cataleptic) person, a comtemporay account of which was published. Although an opponent of the Brownists, his Puritan views on the Ceremonies caused him to be silenced for a time by the Archbishop. One of his opponents, John Robinson of the Leyden Church, well-known in Pilgrim history, described him &quot;as one who sought rather to oppress the person of his adversary with false and proud reproaches than to convince (confute) his tenets with sound arguments&quot; (&quot;Peoples' Plea for the Exercise of Prophecy&quot;, 1618, p. vi), In 1613 he was presented to the living of Batcombe by the patron, the aged Puritan clergyman, Dr. Bisse, and remained ther until his death at the end of March 1641. While here he was indulged in his opposition to the &quot;Ceremonies&quot; by his diocesan. In his &quot;Isle of Man&quot; he urged a better care for prisoners, far in advance of his time. His &quot;Ready Way to Good Works&quot; (1635) advocated systematic charities, a system now in operation. At Batcombe he wrote many books among them &quot;A Guide to Grandjurymen with Respect to Witches&quot; (1627), &quot;Twelve Arguments to prove the Ceremonies imposed upon the ministers of the Church of England by the Prelates are Unlawful&quot;, &quot;Ruth's Recompense&quot;, a commentary on the Book of Ruth, &quot;Fabulous Foundation of the Popedome&quot; (1619), and &quot;Look Beyond Luther&quot; (1628). His posthumus &quot;Thesaurus Biblicus&quot; was published in London in 1644.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C648">648, v113p190</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
