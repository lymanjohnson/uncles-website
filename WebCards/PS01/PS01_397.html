Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">One of the earliest transactions concerning real estate at Sandwich, Mass. between the first settlers is one by Daniel Wing. He acquired his first homestead from Andrew Hallett of Sandwich. He had three acres of corn grew on the land and there was a cow house. It is situated between the land of George Slawson and William Howland and two acres of (meadow) planting land at Ma-noo-nah Skusitt and five acres of planting land lying near Spring Hill and four acres plus one quarter of meadow near Pine Neck. Two acres of meadows lying and one and a half acres lying in the neck being yet under wood. He secured this title on Dec. 5, 1641. He married Hannah Swift, daughter of William and Joan Swift. William died a few months after the marriage and Daniel was bondsman. Joan Swift was a prominent person in Sandwich, she was wealthy and is the only woman who seemed to have been accorded the privilege or uniting with the men in calls to pastors and likened public business.<BR>
<BR>
Daniel was known to like to fish. Hannah Swift, his first wife, died June 1, 1664, three days after the birth of her youngest child, Daniel. They had nine children. Daniel was 45-48 years of age at the time.<BR>
<BR>
Daniel Wing married the second time to Anna Ewer April [or August] 1666. Anna Ewer was the granddaughter (daughter) of Thomas and Sarah Learned.<BR>
<BR>
All the children were born in Sandwich, Mass. Apparently Daniel had been practically stripped of his property by the persecution. The persecution started about March 1657-8. They were one of the first of eighteen families to embrace the Quaker Movement. They were demanding freedom of conscience and a separation of church and state. The Colony was fighting them; they were taken to court several times and paid heavy fines.<BR>
