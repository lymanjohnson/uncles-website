Abigail, daughter of Samuel and Abigail (Collins) Bedle, was baptized on March 1, 1608, Wolverston, Suffolk, England. They were married about 1630 in England. Michael, Abigail and their two oldest daughters immigrated to Massachusetts in 1639 and purchased a lot from Timothy Dalton at Dedham. Timothy had been a minister at Wolverston from 1618 until 1636 and probably knew Michael and Abigail.<BR>
Michael was licensed on May 6, 1646, to open an &quot;ordinary&quot;, which was a small tavern. This is the first recorded tavern in Dedham. In 1648 Michael moved to Boston after apparently selling his tavern to Joshua Fisher.<BR>
At Boston Michael became deeply involved with the Old North Church. He wanted to become a minister, but was refused due to lack of education. Therefore, he served as a lay preacher and elder. Michael died prior to March 20, 1673/73, Boston. Abigail died between March 14 and April 21, 1677.<BR>

His name first appears on the records in New England as one who among others on August 18, 1636, signed the covenant sent to the General Court for an application for a town at Dedham, Norfolk, Mass., which is a few miles southeast of Boston.<BR>
<BR>
Ancestral File says Michael was born December 28, 1605, Romford, Essex, England and died January 28, 1673 with burial on January 31. It also give April 28, 1679 as a death date for Abigail.<BR>
Ancestral File give three additional children named Margaret (b. before 1838, b. c1838, b. June 6, 1649) If this is correct, then the Margaret who married Anthony Howard must have been born in 1649)<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C602">602</A></SUP><BR>
