The first original record we find of him is among a list of debts due on the inventory of Joaeph Holiway &quot;of Sandwidg&quot;, which shows: &quot;It. dew from Willi Giggord&quot; 3s. 4d., 4 Dec 1647 (Plymouth Colony Probates - Mayflower Descendant (hereafter May. Desc.), vol. 7 (1906), p. 208). <BR>

William Gifford served on the Grand Enquest, 4 Jun 1650. The original deed for the Sandwich plantation was executed by Governor Bradford 22 May 1651. It was ordered that four men: Goodman (Thomas) Tupper, Goodman (Thomas) Burges, Senr., Nathaniel Willis, and William Gifford &quot;shall have power to call a town meeting.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
William was a Quaker and his wife, Mary, was a &quot;vagabond&quot; &quot;travelling&quot; Quaker missionary. Per Little Compton Families which cites the Tallman family records by William M. Emery, &quot;William Gifford, a member os the Society of Friends, is found at Sandwich in 1650. although he suffered the persecutions visited upon the Quakers of that time, he prespered in material affairs and became a large land owner. It is supposed that he was the William Gifford who in 1647 or earlier was ordered by the court at Stanford to be whippped and banished. He lived at Sandwich until his death 9 Apr 1687. He was there except for the years 1665 - 1670, when he and others became proprietors of Monmouth Co., N.J., by purchase of land from the Indians. In a deed by his son Christopher, he was described as a tailor. On 10 Nov Mr. Gifford bought of mistress, Sarah Warren of Plymouth, widow of Richard Warren, one half her share in the land at Dartmouth, which by deed 6 May 1683 he gave equally to his sons Christopher and Robert. He also owned land in Sandwich, Falmouth, and Rhode Island.
