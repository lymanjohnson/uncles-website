<BR>
As a specimen of their devotion to their church, the following story is told in Orcutt's Hist. of Derby. During the early days of the settlement before they had the services of a minister, it was customary for the few families then living in Derby to go to Milford to meeting. The father of a family named Johnson (and there was but one here then), consisting of the parents and several small children, went on Sunday morning to Milford for the two services. After his departure as his wife was sitting by the open door dressing the children, she heard a sound outside and thought it was a hog, but somehow it seemed different so she reached and closed the door which fastened with a latch and then rising made it more secure with a bar and went upstairs and looked out of the window, when lo! a full grown bear was seen; she took the gun always ready in those days of Indian alarms and fired killing the animal, although she did not know that for certain until her husband returned at close of day. The hours went slowly there alone in the midst of the wilderness until he came, when he called a council of the neighbors with him to decide whether it would be lawful to eat the meat of an animal killed on Sunday. It was finally decided to be &quot;Christianly consistent to eat the meat as it was killed in self defence.&quot;<BR>
