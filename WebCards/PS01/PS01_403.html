Gifford in his Gifford Genealogy stated that William Gifford, called &quot;the younger,&quot; married Mary Dillingham. No proof for this statement is given. The children are listed as Zaccheus, Hannah, Elizabeth, Molly or Mary, Meribah, Annie, Contents [sic]. Others have copied these data verbatim (see Representative Men and Old Families of Southeastern Massachusetts ... [1912],5; George L. Randall, &quot;Gifford Genealogy,&quot; 1953-54, New Bedford Free Library). Winthrop Alexander in his A Genealogy of the Dillingham Family (N.p., n.d.), 32, gives and account of John Dillingham in which is shown: &quot;5. (Perhaps) Mary who m. William Gifford, b. 16 Feb. 1699, of Falmouth, son William.&quot; We have considered this matter and we suggest the probability that Mr. Alexander, having seen the suggestion that a Mary Dillingham married this William Gifford, was unable, as we have been, to find any original record to support the statement, so he merely noted it with the word &quot;perhaps.&quot; It is possible that Harry Gifford, writing a hundred years ago, may have seen some family papers in support of the allegation, but as failed to find the actual record of the marriage of William Gifford and Mary Swift, this seems to us doubtful. It is a possiblity that William Gifford had a second wife named Mary Dillingham, but is seems probable that some indication of this would appear in the Friends' records. We have found no Dillingham probates that are helpful.<BR>
<BR>
William married 3 Aug 1727, Mary Swift (Falmouth Town Records), daughter of Benjamin Swift (William 3-2-1) and his wife Hannah Wing (Samuel3, Daniel2, John1), born at Sandwich 11 Oct 1706 (May. Desc., 30:104), died 10 Oct 1777. We have found no probates for her parents.<BR>

This William3 Gifford is called &quot;the younger&quot; in all records to distinguish him from his first cousin William Gifford (1673-1733), son of John Gifford. The older William Gifford was called &quot;junr.,&quot; and in 1727 he was married to his second wife, Experience (Bowerman)(Claghorn) Gifford, who survived him. Mary Swift, similarly, could not have married William2 Gifford whose wife, Lydia Hatch, was living in 1727<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C648">648, v129p229</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
