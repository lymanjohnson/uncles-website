Dr. Ebenezer Burgess states in his book that Thomas Burgess, the eldest son of Thomas the Pilgrim, was enrolled to bear arms in 1643, when probably 16 years old. He died after 1687. <BR>
<BR>
He married twice. He married Elizabeth Bassett 8 November 1648 in Sandwich, Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Elizabeth was born circa 1626. Elizabeth was divorced from Thomas Burgess (Jr.) 10 June 1661 in Plymouth Colony. He was brought before the Court for misconduct with Lydia Gaunt. He was sentenced to be whipped and to forfeit one third of his net worth; the sentence was carried out. Because of his misconduct with Lydia Gaunt, his wife Elizabeth divorced him, the first divorce in the Colony. He then left Sandwich and settled in Newport, R.I. Elizabeth &quot;married Thomas Burgess in 1648 (PCR 8:6) and divorced him in 1661 after he was brought to court for an act of uncleanness with Lydia Gaunt (the first divorce in Plymouth Colony), and the Court allowed Elizabeth to keep small things 'that are in William Basset's hands' (PCR 3:221)&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He married Lydia Gaunt about 1661. Lydia was born perhaps about 1636 in England. She died after 1697 probably in Rhode Island. She was baptized in St. Peter's, Gowts, Lincolnshire, England on 2 April 1636.<BR>
<BR>
He was named in Thomas Burgess's will 4 April 1684 in Sandwich, Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Thomas was enrolled to bear arms in 1643. He served the town [Sandwich] as constable in 1654. He subscibed to repair the meeting-house, and to support the minister, in 1657. In 1661 he left the Plymouth Colony, and removed to Newport. He was admitted a freeman in the Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and served as grand juror, in 1667. <BR>
<BR>
Rev. Dr. Ebenezer Burgess in BURGESS GENEALOGY 1865 states on page 12 the following, &quot;His second wife was Lydia, daughter of Peter Gaunt, by whom he had one son, and probably other children.&quot; </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
