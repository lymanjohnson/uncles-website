On his right is buried Mary Hodgman, wife of Thomas, who died November 10, 1735, aged 95. It is believed she was the eldest daughter of Edward.<BR>
<BR>
There is an obvious discrepancy between the birth date and age at death as marked on the gravestone. Since we have no reason to doubt the parentage and birth record, this mistake may be attributed to the person marking the stone, or to the fact that the elderly tend to forget and add a few years to their age. <SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C174">174</A></SUP><BR>

Edward Kibbe emigrated to the Boston area some time around 1645, and set up a sawmill on the Muddy River in what is now Brookline, Mass.   It is probable that Edward did not move to Reading to live near his children until after his wife died. That Edward Kibbe was active in community affairs is indicated by some records of his service. In 1662 he was appointed Clerk of Market, a position created, probably, to give the Muddy River area Representation in Boston Markets. From 1666 to 1683 he served intermittently as Surveyor of Highways. Edward and his wife are listed in 1674 as contributors to the fund for the second meeting house in Roxbury, Mass. Above from Kibbe Genealogical Notes on some descendants of Edward Kibbe and his wife, Mary (Partridge) Kibbe compiled by Doreen Potter Hanna 1972 Ms. Hanna used the spelling &quot;Kibbe&quot; through out her book dispite the fact that records showed various spellings including: Keebe, Kibby, Kibbey, Kibbee, and Kibbie. <BR>
