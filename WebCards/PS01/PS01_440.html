He came to Sandwich with his daughter aged twelve and a two year old son, became an outstanding citizen of the community and developed exceptional ability. He served in the General Court in 1644 and later was deputy for 20 years, from 1647 to 1667; he served on juries, local boards and commissions, was a charter member of the church and for three years from 1667 was a selectman of the twon. In his later years, when there was no settled minister, Mr. Tupper conducted religious services as layman and he was deeply interested in religious work among the Indians. He was a shrewd trader and invested heavily in real estate and held large holdings at his death.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C648">648, v99p59</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
