David Wooster. <BR>
<BR>

Apr. 11-1672, it mentions &quot;the last Commares (comers) to the place as, Ebenezer Johnson, Moses Johnson, John Tibbals, Stephen peirson and Joshua Hodgkis.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In 1678 Ebenezer Johnson is appointed constable, townsman and to keep ordinary (the first in town). In 1685 he was appointed Lieut. of the 1st regular military company organized in the town. During the same year he and Jeremiah Johnson built upon the land they owned in vicinity of Rock Rimmon. <BR>
<BR>
In 1681 Sergt. Ebenezer Johnson's estate (personal) 2 persons. 36 ¦., 3 horses, 3 oxen, 3 cows, 1- 3 yr old, 1- 3yr old horse, 1- 2yr old horse, 6 swine, 1- 2 yr old, Land, ¦.104, 16S. <BR>
<BR>
In 1689 he was commissioned by the General Court to the office of Capt. in a volunteer company raised to aid England against the French in the twenty-four years war that followed. In this war he went on two expeditions to Albany and one to New York besides others against the Indians of his own state, and to protect the seacoast. He was also appointed as one of the commissioners, or governor's council for several years during the war and as such seems to have been depended upon as much as any one in the state. <BR>
<BR>
He was justice of the peace from 1698 to 1716, and representative from 1685 to 1723, a term of thirty-eight years, the equal of which is seldom known in any state. For his public services the town gave him 175 acres of land at &quot;Quaker's Farm&quot;, he also received of the state, by vote of the General Assembly, in 1700 three hundred acres of land as a recognition of his public services during the French and Indian War. <BR>
<BR>
He was appointed seargeant-major of the New Haven county militia in 1704 and upon the Colonial Records for 1709 is the following: &quot;Upon consideration of the age and long service of Maj. Ebenezer Johnson, major of the regt of militia in the county of New Haven this assembly have thought meet to excuse and do now hereby excuse and release him from further labour in that post&quot;, but the French war continuing he was commissioned Colonel of the expedition organized to go to Port Royal in 1710. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nov. 10-1710 Ordered paid unto Col. Johson 46s. for 8 gals of rum, which he bought at sea for the soldiers on board the brigantine instead of beer on the expedition against Port Royal.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
After this expedition he was more respected and honored than before, although in 1701 the town clerk writes &quot;The worshipful Major Johnson&quot; denoting the highest honor. <BR>
<BR>
Derby Published Records pp. 245. Dec. 1707. &quot;Voted yt Maj. Johnson shall according to his desire set at the end of the pulpit in a short seat alone and yt the town be at suteable charge to make it hansome and convenient to entertain the said Major honorably: At the same time Voted yt Mrs. Bowers, Mrs. Johnson, and Mrs. Moss shall sit in said seat on the women's side next the pulpit which is made with banister like a pew.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Col. Johnson was participant in many stirring events, one of particular interest is spoken of in the Colonial Records of Conn. as follows, &quot;Cyprian Nichols and Ebenezer Johnson were members of the Assembly in June 1687 when sundry of the Court at Hartford desired that the patent or charter might be brought into the court, which the record leaves in the box on the table at the adjurnment and with the key in the box, at which time perhaps the original charter was taken by Messrs Stanley and Talcott and concealed, it may be by Mr. Leete. Messrs. Nichols and Johnson were also members and present on the 31st of Oct. when Sir. Edmund Andros assumed the government and demanded the charter whereupon the incident of extinguishing the lights occurred and the duplicate charter was secured by Capt. Wadsworth. The Assembly met and sat late at night, the charter was ordered placed on the table, when suddenly all the candles were snuffed out at once and when relighted the charters were gone. <BR>
<BR>
A story was told by Capt. David Treat Johnson of Oxford, Conn. concerning one of the women of this family showing they were as courageous as the men. One of his great grandmother's was seated in her kitchen one day when she heard a noise near her and saw an Indian's head protrude through a hole which he had made in the log wall; making no noise she seized an axe near by and bringing it down with all her might severed the head from the body, pulling the latter into the room; another head appearing she repeated the performance until six decapitated Indians were within, if any others were outside they did not try to follow their companions.&quot; In those days of isolation and Indian alarms the women needed all their nerve for emergencies. <BR>
<BR>
Col. Ebenezer Johnson married 1st Elizabeth daughter of Edward and Elizabeth (French) Wooster, on Nov. 23-1671. She died in 1672 leaving a baby daughter born Dec. 20-1672, who married Jeremiah Johnson Jr. <BR>
<BR>
Col. Ebenezer Johnson married 2nd. Hannah daughter of Jonas and Hannah Tomlinson on Nov. 23-1676. He died Sept. 18-1726. <BR>
<BR>
On New Haven Probate Records, vol. 5, pp. 317, Col. Ebenezer Johnson's will is given. To wife Hannah he gives maid servant Dinah and west side of his Mansion House, moveable goods, cattle etc. To son Peter, land in Camp's Mortgage, To son Ebenezer land above Bladen's Brook, also land in the &quot;Quaker's Farm&quot; Purchase. He divided his land at Seymour between his sons Timothy and Charles, one taking the east side of the River, and the other the west. His homestead on the southern side of New Haven Sentinel Hill he gave to his son Ebenezer Jr. and to Peter one hundred acres adjoining to Pootatuck River and another piece of fifty acres adjoining Two-mile Brook. He also mentions Grandson Return Strong. To daughter Elizabeth 70 pounds, also daughter Eunice Strong and Hannah Curtis. To Rev. Joseph Moss ¦5. Will probated Sept. 30-1726. <BR>
<BR>
Col. Ebenezer Johnson's children by his 2nd wife were: Eunice born Aug. 22-1678, Hannah born Dec. 6-1680, Peter born Oct. 9-1684, Ebenezer born Feb. 22-1686, Israel born Apr. 13-1689 died Jan. 31-1712, Timothy born Dec. 23, 1693, Charles born Dec. 29-1696. <BR>
<BR>
Col. Ebenezer Johnson was a man of most remarkable character and business ability, in 1706 he is said to have virtually transacted all the business of the town. He had great ability in all dealings with the Indians, they having the greatest respect and consideration for him, and in all difficulties with them was always chosen to treat with them and pacify them; he and Henry Wooster were the two men skilled in all diplomatic dealings with the red men. Col. Johnson was a man of unquestioned courage and prominent in all the wars of his time from King Philip's down. It was during his fight with the Pequots that he is said to have found on the battlefield the next morning, &quot;Tobie&quot; then a small child, and taken him home as part of the spoils of war and brought him up to manhood when he gave him his freedom. <BR>
<BR>
Col. Johnson's homestead was a little off the New Haven Road, and the remains of the cellar are still to be seen (1926). The house directly on the road he is said to have built and given to his son Ebenezer Jr. the ell on the rear is said to have been moved from the older house and may have been the slave quarters that housed the slaves of which he was possessed. The house is very interesting with two large chimneys, fine carved moldings and panelled doors. It is in very good condition. <BR>
<BR>
Col. Johnson received all the honors the town and colony could give him and died at a ripe old age respected and beloved by all. <SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C573">573</A></SUP><BR>
