<BR>
Thomas Angell was born England before 1619 and likely much earlier since he calls himself &quot;very Aged&quot; in his 1685 will. He died in Providence, RI between August 1688 (Providence estate tax) and 18 September 1694 when his will was proved. He married possibly at Providence before 1642, Alice Ashton. He came from London as servant or apprentice of Roger Williams, as one tradition has it, but another tradition says, of Richard Waterman. <BR>
<BR>
On 27 July 1640 Angell was one of the thirty-nine signers of an agreement for a government. He took his status as an inhabitant and Freeman of Providence very seriously and was politically active until the last decade of his life. He was one of the twelve signers of the Providence Oath of Allegiance, making his curious circular mark. A forecful and opinionated man, he held many town offices, despite being illiterate (or at least unable to write). He was a member of the Town Council in 1650 and was also surveyor and commissioner that year. He was one of the six jurymen in 1650, 1652 and 1659.<BR>
<BR>
In December of 1652, Angell filled an important position as one of the six Providence commissioners at the General Assembly at Hugh Bewitt's trial for high treason. Bewitt had been found guilty by the Court of Trials and he appealed to the Court of Commissioners, and Angell and the five other commissioners acquitted him, sparing Bewitt the dreadful punishment reserved for traitors. Angell was frequently associated with matters of defense, upholding of the law, and other physical matters.<BR>
<BR>
On 25 3mo 1653, he was ordered a commissioner to meet with the Warwick commissioners regarding Captain Underhill and Mr. Dyer and the manner and means of making war upon the Dutch. Due to the merchant trade up and down the coast, there were several inter-marriages between Dutch and Providence colonists. This did not prevent the Council of State from directing the people to annoy the Dutch and forbidding them to send provisions. In one of the most aggressive responses from a New England colony, Rhode Island voted cannon and small arms and twenty volunteers be sent to the English on Long Island. <BR>
<BR>
Thomas Angell acted as constable for the town of Providence in the precedent-setting case of Richard Chasmore, in which Rhode Island's sovereignty over its citizens versus the authority of the Massachusetts Bay Colony was tested. The men of Rhode Island took exception to the Massachusetts Bay Colony authorities assuming that they had jurisdiction on Rhode Island land. They further resented the implication that Roger Williams was the only man in Rhode Island with any power. By standing strong and silent in this altercation, Thomas Angell and his four deputies withstood the implied challenges of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. <BR>
<BR>
Roger Williams brought a presentment against Thomas Harris, William Wickenden and Thomas Angell on 13 March 1656/7, charging them as ringleaders in the new division in the colony. Harris was charged with treason as a result of his view of liberty, which differed from those of Williams but the charge was dropped. The three men appeared in court and three times an appeal was made for the prosecutor to come forward, but Williams did not come and no other appears to take his place, so the men were dismissed. The divisiveness in question was a matter of teachings on the nature of liberty, Angell apparently being a strong adherent of Harris' rather than an originator of the concepts involved. <BR>
<BR>
Thomas Angell was a juror on the inquest upon the body of Margaret Goodwin 4 3mo 1651 [sic, more likely 1657] when the jury made the curious assessment that, &quot;the terribleness of the crack of thunder on the second of the third month, 165[], or the coldness of the night, being she was naked did kill her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Robert West filed a complaint against Thomas Angell on 27 August 1646 for having trapped and attacked some of West's swine with a pitchfork after they had entered Angell's property in July. Thomas killed a sow and &quot;bruisd as black as a shoe&quot; some of the pigs. Angell was ordered to pay damages for the dead sow and for the value of her skin, which had been torn by the pitchfork.<BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of King Philip's War, the neutrality of Providene wsa respected by the Wampanoags, close friends to Roger Williams from the beginning of his settlement. The harm came when colonists from these two towns joined the United Colonies army as it marched through, violating the town's neutrality. The Narragansetts were wintered in a swamp of four or five acres in the area now known as South Kingston. The results of the &quot;Great Swamp Fight&quot; were a small number of colonists killed and well over one thousand Narragansetts and Wampanoags killed, hundreds by burning to death in their wigwams, and countless more starved when their provisions for the winter were burned in the battle. On 26 Mar 1676, a small force of colonists was attacked by the Narragansetts on the Massachusetts side. Outnumbered, the surviving colonials escaped, bringing news to Providence. Three days later, Providence was attacked, evidently the Narragansetts' first violation of the town's neutrality. Though Roger Williams pleaded for peace, the Narragansetts set fire to the town. Shortly after the burning of Providence, Canonchet, who had led the Narragansetts, was captured and taken to Stonington where he was shot and shortly thereafter, King Philip was killed and the war ended. <BR>
<BR>
At the annual town meeting 5 June 1676, five Providence men were chosen to settle the question of what to do with the surviving Indians. As one of these five, Thomas Angell made his mark to the decision that they should be placed in servitude for a number of years, according to their present ages. Other colonies were not so generous, either killing their vanquished enemies or selling them to permanent slavery in distant lands. <BR>
<BR>
Thomas Angell dropped out of public service in the 1680's, though he appeared on the regular tax lists from 1680 through 1684. That the inventories of both Thomas and Alice Angell were taken the same day, coupled with the fact that Thomas paid no taxes after 1688, suggests that Thomas died about 1689 and that the family waited until Alice died in December of 1694 before probating their estates.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Will</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">His will was written 23 May 1685, at least three years before his death.
