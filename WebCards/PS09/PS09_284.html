He had by 1302 a first wife Joan de Grey, who died before 1339-40 when he had a second wife, Amy or Anne, as described below. John and Joan are named in 1302 in the settlement of Walpen. In 1310-11 John bought an acre of land in Farnborough, and in 1321-22 he and Joan acquired the whole manor from Jordan de Say.<BR>

In 1314 there was pardon to John de Ralegh and Joan his wife for acquiring without licence from William de Spalding a messuage and a carucate of land, 18d of rent, and a rent of two capons in Molington, Oxfordshire (less than three miles from Farnborough); the grant was for the life of the said Joan with remainders to their son John, to Katherine his sister, and to John de Grey of Rotherfield. This record is important because it substantiates the claim in the Visitation pedigree that Joan was a de Grey of Rotherfield. However, Joan was the sister, not the daughter, of the first Lord Grey of Rotherfield.<BR>

In 1316 John de Ralegh was a tenant in Molington, but his name does not appear in the aid for Devon in that year. In 1324 John, son of Henry de Ralegh, man at arms of Devon, was to attend the Great Council. In the same year Dugdale found him in the list of esquires from Warwickshire and concluded that he resided there. In 1327-28 he was a knight</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
