Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">In 1449 it was found that Joan late the wife of Reynold Grey of Tuthin, knight, on the day of her death held tenements in Nethershukburgh, Averderset, Northend of Derset, Upton by Rotteley, Napton, Wormeleyghton, and Kyngton for the term of her life in dower of Thomas Ralegh late her husband, with reversion to William Ralegh, the knsman and heir of the said Thomas, to wit, son of John Ralegh the brother of the said Thomas; the escheator in Warwick was to take the fealty of the said William and cause him to have full seisin of the premises<BR>
<BR>
In 1450 William Raleigh, esq., and Elizabeth his wife and John Onley and Idonis his wife settled the manors of Farnborough, Cledon, and Laundsfe, Eggesworth, Lassyngton, Charles, Westhagynton, Westbokelond, Walston and Courtesknoll on Edward Brounflete, esq., with reversion after Edward's death to William and his heirs. Idonis, wife of John Onley, may have been either William's sister or his mother.<BR>
<BR>
In 1452 William Ralegh was among the feoffees of Kegworth who demised that manor to Thomas Greene and Matilda his wife, as presented to the jurors at an inquisition post mortem on this Thomas Greene who died 9 Sep 1462, son of Thoma Greene who died 18 Jan 1451/62 and his wife  Philippa Ferrers (NEGHR 123:180-1)<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C648">648, v145p15</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
The death of William Rawleigh, esquire, occurred while Henry VI was a prisioner of the Yorkists. William was holding Spalding fee in Molyngton, Cledon manor, Sagefee in Bourton Magna, and land in Williamscote and Copredy id Oxfordshire; land in Neubolt and Clipston in Northamptonshire; and Assh Raff; and lands in Walstone and Curtis Kno, in Devonshire. The dating no doubt reflects the distubances arising from the War of the Roses.<BR>
<BR>
According to a delayed inquisition taken in the Isle of Wight in 1508, his son and heir Edward Rawlegh, knight, immediately after William's death had entered the primises: land called Wodehouse, Chelyngwod, and Walpanne, worth 20 l. held in chief.<BR>
<BR>
Because his son and heir, Edward, was still in his minority, a grant was made 24 Dec 1461 for keeping William Ralegh's lands, together with the wardship and marriage of the heir.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C648">648, v145p16</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
