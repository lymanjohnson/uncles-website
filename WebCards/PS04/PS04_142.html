HISTORY of FAIRFIELD GENEALOGIES<BR>
By Elizabeth Hubbell SCHENCK p. 359. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Peter, the youngest son of the Rev. Peter BULKLEY did not settle at Fairfield until some time after his brothers. He probably married Margaret FOXCROFT, of Boston, as in a record in A. of T. D. he sold to the heirs of Francis FOXCROFT all interest he and his wife had in said FOXCROFT's house in Boston, for £90. Francis FOXCROFT is said to be the son of Daniel FOXCROFT, mayor of Leeds, in Co. York, &amp; his second wife was Eliza, daughter of Gov. DANFORD. Dr. Peter BUCKLEY was an apothecary as well as a physician in Fairfield. He left but a small estate. His will is dated 25 March 1691, in which he calls himself &quot;in the 49th year of his age,&quot; mentions son Peter (born 1683) then seven, &amp; a quarter years old, who upon arriving at a suitable age, he willed should be bound to Jmes BENNET Jr. until of age, to be taught &quot;the art of weaving both linen &amp; woolen, to ye best of his capacity.&quot; he mentions daughters Grace, Margaret &amp; Hannah SHERMAN. His brother Rev. Dr. GershomBUCKLEY of Weathersfield, mentions two other children of Dr. Peter BUCKLEY's viz: Gershom &amp; Dorothy.<BR>

THE BULKELEY GENEALOGY<BR>
Compilied By<BR>
Donald Lines JACOBUS, M.A. <BR>
<BR>
(Dr.) Peter BULKELEY (Peter1), born at Concord, Mass., 12 August 1643, died at Fairfield, Conn., in 1691; married Margaret &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, who died before 1691. <BR>
<BR>
He was a member of the class of 1662 at hrvard College, but did not receive a degree. <BR>
<BR>
The will of Peter, dated 25 March 1691, two eldest daughters Grace and Margrit; &quot;that fflock bed yt is at Hanna SHERMANS there let it remain: or if young James BENNIT have it it shall be only upon Courtisey&quot;; Peter to be apprenticed to James to learn weaving; mentioned a mare now at Daniel SILLIMAN's; brother Gershom BULKLY sole Executor. The Executor refusing, to administration was granted to John and Joseph BULKLEY and Samuel ROBENSON, any two of them. <BR>
<BR>
His inventory, dated 17 July 1691, included &quot;mediene simple &amp; in Composition&quot; valued at £25 and &quot;Books Inglish and Latin.&quot; He was a physician. <BR>
<BR>
On 29 June 1688 Peter BULKLEY of Fairfield, apothecary, and Margaret his wife, mortgaged his dwelling house and land in Fairfield for £90 to Frances FOXCROFT of Boston, merchant; deed witnessed by Thomas HILL and Frances SEDENHAM. On 31 March 1691Mstrs. SEDENHAM of Fairfield as Attorney to Francis FOXCROFT of Boston entered a caveat against peter BULKLY's house and land in Fairfield, in reference to a suit in law to be brought before the next Fairfield County Court. Claims which have been made to the effect that Peter's wife was a FOXCROFT are based on nothing more substantial than these two entries in the land records. thep prove nothingof the kind; and investigation leads to the negative conclusion that Margaret was not a FOXCROFT. <BR>
<BR>
Peter's five children are named in the will of his brother, Rev. Gershom, and there is nothing to indicate that there were other surviving children. Statements that he had a daughter Hannah who married Matthew SHERMAN seem to owe their origin to the clause in his will quoted above. A monument erected in 1885 in the Stratfield Cemetery names the wife of Matthew SHERMAN as &quot;Hannah BULKLEY.&quot; </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
