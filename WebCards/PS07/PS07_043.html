Nov. 27, 1608, and his sister Alice, boarded the Arabella with the Winthrop Fleet and sailed to Massachusetts. They were joined about three years later by their sisters Dorcas and Susan, who were servants for the Winthrop family, like Alice. Thomas was a humble tailor when he married Mary Scudamore, who was a member of the prominent family. Thomas, Jr. and Mary lived a long life together in Ipswich. Thomas fought in the Pequot war, for which he obtained some land. He left a will and we have the inventory of his property. At the time of his death he owned five sheep, three lambs, four cows and eight swine. Settlement to the west was hindered by Indians, who killed some Frenches and drove others back from the frontier.&quot; [FFA Chart 1]<BR>
<BR>
On April 8, 1630 The Arbella departed Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, and arrived at Salem, Massachusetts, June 13 and following days. Flagship of the &quot;Winthrop Fleet&quot;<BR>

Possibly from &quot;Fifty Families from Essex County, England&quot;, sent by Mara French, book by John Threlfall: &quot;Thomas was baptized 27 Nov. 1608 at Assington, Sufrolk, England. He came to New England with the Winthrop Fleet of eleven ships carrying about 700 colonists, which sailed from Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, in April and May, 1630, and which arrived in June and July following. The first of these ships landed at Salem on 13 June. Thomas French first settled in Boston and presumably was married there about the next year, 1631. His wife is identified only as Mary. Thomas French was made a freeman of the colony on 6 Nov 1632. About 1634 he moved to Ipswich and appears there on record first in 1635 in the following land records.<BR>
20 April 1635-There was Granted to Thomas Scott ... Likewise an hous lott in Mill Streete havinge Thomas French on the Southeast.<BR>
20 April 1635-There was Granted to Robert Mussey ... likewise an hous lott in Mill Streete lyinge betweene Thomas French and Richard Jacob.<BR>
20 Feb. 1636/7-There was granted to Serg. French ten acres of upland at the hither end of a Neck lying beyond Reedy marsh, to be laid out by the lott layers. Granted to Sedent French, a parcell of upland and medow containing about three acres on the South side of th River, adjoyning his planting lott.<BR>
<BR>
From these we know that his house was on Bridge Street just off Mill Street.<BR>
<BR>
About 1637 his parents and his younger brother and sisters joined him at Ipswich. Three sisters had crossed over to New England earlier.<BR>
<BR>
Thomas French fought in the Pequot War in 1637, for in 1672, he petitioned the colonial government for a grant of land northeast of Salisbury in behalf of himself and eight other Ipswich men who had been of service in that campaign.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Brian Berry: &quot; His name [Thomas French, Jr.] appears on the list of original members of the First Church of Boston between those of John Winthrop, Jr. and his wife.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thomas took the Freeman's Oath in Boston 6 Nov. 1632. He was in Boston when, &quot;this 17th of the first month Called March, 1634&quot; John Stratton wrote to John Winthrop, Jr. &quot;in Aggawaam per Jno. Gallopps boate&quot; that &quot;I have putt my sister a suite of Moyheare to making att Goom. Frenches, she were best gett the taylor to take her Measure and send per Jno. Gallop.&quot;(Winthrop Papers, Vol. III, pp. 156-7). Agawam, later Ipswich, had been planted by John Winthrop Jr. and twelve others in 1633). From this, and from a 1647 deed, we know he was a tailor.<BR>
<BR>
His will, dated Aug. 3, 1680, was proved 28 Sept. 1680; inv. 25 Aug.1680.<BR>
There is no record of Thomas and Mary's marriage, but seven children are known, the conception of the first is consistent with a marriage in MA in1631.<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------<BR>
England in the 17th century was a land beset by religious strife. Unlike our country today, this strife was intertwined with the politics of the day and led to a rebellion and the beheading of a King. It led to a country led by Oliver Cromwell.<BR>
<BR>
The Puritans who landed in America were able to keep out of this strife. They were not involved with the &quot;Separatists&quot; who wished to break from the Church of England. They wished to reform the church from within, but found that the conservative elements were too entrenched and they were unable to make any significant changes. Realizing this they looked around for an alternative which would allow them to worship the way they would like to.<BR>
<BR>
One alternative was the Massachusetts Bay Company. This company was one of many formed, and approved by the King, to settle and exploit the New World. While looking into this company, the Puritans found one significant item in the companies charter, which was invaluable to their aims. The Charter for the Massachusetts Bay Company did not specify where the Board of Directors would meet. Most, if not all other, companies charters called for their Board of Director meetings to be held in London where they would be underthe direct influence of Parliament and the King. The Puritans realized that if they gained control of the Massachusetts Bay Company they would be able to use it to settle in the New World where, because of this omission, they would be able to effectively control their own destiny. They would in effect be able to rule the colony from the New World rather then from England with all of its politics and external influences.<BR>
<BR>
The Puritans bought control of the Massachusetts Bay Company and began toplan for their religious colony in the New World. One thing they had to do was weed out any individuals wanting to go to the New World in a quest for financial gain rather then as a Puritan. John Winthrop was selected as the leader for this settlement.<BR>
<BR>
On April 7, 1630 the first four ships left London for the New World.These ships were followed by a number of others over the next few months. These ships included the flagship &quot;Arbella&quot;,the &quot;Ambrose&quot;, the &quot;Talbot&quot;, the &quot;Jewel&quot;, the &quot;Charles&quot;, the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, the &quot;William and Francis&quot;, the&quot;Hopewell&quot;, the &quot;Whale&quot;, the &quot;John and Dorothy&quot;, the &quot;Rose&quot; and the &quot;Success and Trial&quot;. About one thousand settlers left England for the Massachusetts Bay Colony.<BR>
<BR>
The first winter proved to be exceedingly harsh as about two hundred persons died. It had been so bad that another two hundred opted to return to England in the following spring. The colony only survived due to the leadership of John Winthrop. Not only did he prove to be an inspired leader but he helped stave off starvation by buying supplies with his own money. This venture proved costly to John Winthrop both financially and personally. Three of his children died in the New World.<BR>
<BR>
Despite these early problems the colony prospered and thousands followed the initial fleet to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Puritans were able to rule this colony themselves according to their religious tenants. While the Puritans eventually lost power, their influence has continued to affect not only New England but also the entire country.<BR>

<BR>
The parentage of Mary Scudamore is in question. A birth date of 1612 is obviously impossible based on the death date of her father. IGI Film 2034596 shows a Mary Scudamore, christened in 1612 in Gloucester, Essex, MA with parents William Scudamore and Elizabeth Clarvo. Unfortunately, IGI records also show the marriage to be about 1614 or 1615 in either Gloucester MA or Gloucester, England (which of course conflicts with a 1612 birth date for Mary).<BR>
<BR>
Ancestral file showing Mary's parents to be William Scudamore, b. 1564(AF 8MGZ-3J) and Frances Lechmere, b.1568 ( AF 8MGZ-4P) appears to be in error.<BR>
<BR>
Mary. She married _______ French &quot;of Boston in New England&quot;, according to Mayes Visitation. She and her children are remembered in the will of their uncle William Scudamore in 1636. [She is frequently said to have married Thomas French (born 1608, died 1680) of Ipswich, Essex County, Massachusetts, and to have died his widow on 8 May 1681 at Ipswich. If this should be so she would have been several years older than her husband and approaching 90 years of age at her death. This<BR>
identification, for which no proof has yet been found, is to be received with considerable caution. [Warren Skidmore]<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C613">613</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
