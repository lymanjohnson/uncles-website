Henry Jackson was probably the man who came [from London, England] in the ship Elizabeth &amp; Ann in 1635, aged 29, having taken the oath of aliegiance &amp; supremacy to the crown, &amp; brought a certificate from the minister &amp; justice of the peace, in the place he resided in England, (not mentioned) of his conformity to the Church of England, &amp; that he was no subsidy man. (Hotten's List of Emigrants to America.) In the same ship came Robert Hawkins, Nicholas St. John &amp; several of the Whitney family. He was at Watertown [Massachusetts] in 1637, &amp; was, says Savage, &quot;one of the lessers of the fishing grounds of that place.&quot; He was at Fairfield in 1648, where Feb. 2, 1648/9 he made an agreement with the town to erect a grist-mill on the stream running into the west side of Uncoway River, which he sold in 1653 to Samuel Morehouse. His home-lot was bounded n.w. with Nathan Gold's pasture lot, n.e. the Unocoway mill-creek at high water-mark, s.e. highway, &amp; s.w. with his own land. He removed after selling the mill, to Pequonnock &amp; purchased, the house &amp; home-lot of Thomas Wheeler jr. He was made a freeman 10 Oct. 1669 and was one of the dividend land holders of the town.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C565">565</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Will</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">His will is dated 11, Nov. 1682, in which he provides for a wife (Christian name not mentioned); to son Moses housing &amp; Ludlow's lot, except one acre at Pequonnock, and in Uncoway Indian Fields; 1&#166;4 of his pasture-lot, building-lot &amp; long-lot: to the children of his deceased daughter Hannah, who had married Philip Galpin, 5£ each when of age; to s.

He entailed all his estate to his surviving male heirs, in case of the death of any one of his sons.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C565">565</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
