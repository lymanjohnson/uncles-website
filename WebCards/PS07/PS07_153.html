It presents a rare and very human picture of contemporary life:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I, William Gifford, aged about fourty years or therabouts, Declare &amp; say That I, being called from my house by Indian Cappe of Sukanesset on 15 April last, to go with himself &amp; a little Indian boy, called Little Cappe, to help kill a parcell of Fishes which he said were near the shore at a place called Little Sepawissit - I readily went a Long with him, and said Little Cappe carried along with us a long-billed axe and two other small axes and when we came to ye lea side, we say a little ffish, which was a very one, yt was killed and lay upon the shore, which Cappe said that Little Cappe told him yt he had killed &amp; hauled on shore which there was reason to believe, because it seemed to be newly stabbed and killed, by his bleeding afresh. And then we rushed into ye water, the rest of ye sd ffishes being near the shore and Cappe killed or wounded all said Fish &amp; having so done, we went up to a wigwam not far distant to refresh ourselves, we being exceeding spent &amp; tired with our labours and after which I proposed (being a stranger to such ffish) to have made an enquiry for information as to their worth, whereupon John Robinson came occasionally to me and informed me what ffish they were, when he came to see them; and the tide being down, some of sd Fishes remained with life in them and we, taking advantage of the season (for some of them now lay dry and others a ground) worked so long upon them we supposed we had killed them all, and now night drawing on, we thought to have secured said ffish by seizing or fastening of them, but the wind arising at West &amp; blew hard &amp; being fair to bring them on shore we left them for the night. Veras copies attest Jona Elatson, Clark.&quot;</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Will</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">unto my loving wife Lydia Gifflr, one half of all my household stuff, as bed, pewter, iron, chests... besides her right of dower...
