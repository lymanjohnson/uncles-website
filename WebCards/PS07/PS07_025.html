John settled north of Freshwater on the main street. Was chosen Surveyorin 1751; constable, 1748, tax collector 1749. He became an early settlerof Windsor, CT, where he owned a large share of the town, and had wealth and enterprise.<BR>

[Carrie Edgett article: He seems to have been a more prominent citizen of Enfield than either of his brothers. He was chosen hog reive, fenceviewer, constable, collector of rates or taxes, surveyor, tythingman, ...<BR>
Marriage is proved by a deed dated Jan. 6, 1749, from Jonathan, Joshua,Moses, Aaron, and Caleb Bush, Richard French, Jun., and Miriam his wife,John French, and Rachel his wife, Job Larkham, and Mary his wife, and Elizabeth Bush, spinster. All of these except Miriam agree with the names of the recorded children of Jonathan and Rachel Bush. John French also served in the French and Indian War, from May to September, 1758,when he was a sergeant. His will, dated Feb. 27, 1759, presented Jan.22, 1776, names wife Rachel, children Rachell, Eleanor, Azubah, John, andLevia, and makes wife Rachel and son John executors.<BR>

FFA Chart 1 shows 2 other marriages - 1) Lydia Phelps and 2) MarthaPhelps, born October 6, 1720 in East Windsor CT m about 1736. Also showsa child Martha French, born between 1756-1758 (different IGI records) in East Windsor, Hartford, CT. IGI shows Martha French to have parents,John French and Lydia Phelps. However, as noted above, &quot;our&quot; John French had his wife Rachel until he died, so could not have had a child Marthaborn to Lydia in 1756-58. Also, his will dated 1759 does not mention achild named Martha. So assume it must be another John French thatmarried Lydia Phelps.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
