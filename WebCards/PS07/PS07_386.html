<BR>
Edward first married Elizabeth Barker, in Leiden, Holland.1&nbsp;Elizabeth died on 24 Mar 1621 in Plymouth, MA.<BR>
<BR>
On 12 May 1621 Edward second married Susanna [White], in Plymouth, MA.1&nbsp;Susanna died aft 18 Dec 1654.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the oft repeated claim that Susanna was Anna, the sister of Dr. Samuel &amp; Edward Fuller, the known facts do not support this claim.<BR>
<BR>
Says Goodwin, &quot;The first marriage in the Colony occurred May 21st, 1621, between Edward Winslow (afterwards Governor), who had been a widower only seven weeks, and Susanna White (mother of Peregrine), a widow not twelve weeks, but the case was exceptional. Winslow should be at the head of a household, and the White children needed a paternal guardian. The marriage proved fortunate for all concerned. Among Mrs. Winslow's subsequent children was Josiah, whom 52 hears later she saw the first native Governor of an American Colony. The forefathers of Marshfield and elsewhere throughout the Colony did not marry before clergymen, but performed the ceremony before magistrates for many years, not because in their earliest days they had no clergymen (Elder Brewster was a layman, although performing many of the duties of a clergyman) but because our fathers held that the Scriptures and the early Christians had not empowered clergymen to perform marriages, believing it to be a civil compact only between man and woman.&quot; Gov. Bradford's eldest son married Martha, a daughter of Thomas Bourne, of Marshfield.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
They had the following children:<BR>
 i. (infant child) (Died as Infant) (1622-1622)<BR>
 ii. Edward (ca1624-)<BR>
 iii. John (ca1626-)<BR>
 iv. Josias (&gt;1627-)<BR>
 v. Elizabeth (ca1631-)<BR>
