He built a house that is still standing, the oldest house of any French in America. John's sons moved to Enfield and Norwich, in Connecticut and remained there a generation or two. Some Frenches from the next generation were the first to head west, and later Frenches in this line kept moving, and passed through New York to Iowa, on to Kansas, Missouri, Indiana, and Nebraska.
