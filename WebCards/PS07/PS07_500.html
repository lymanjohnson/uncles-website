The book that Pynchon wrote refered to below was published in England in 1650. When in came to Massachusetts, the authorities condemned it and forced Pynchon to recant. At the time he was the magistrate (the government) in Springfield. He returned to England in 1652. His recantations were obviously false, because in 1655 a new addition of his book was published.<BR>
<BR>
There is also a better description of his role in Springfield at NEHGR vol 133 July 1979 page 163.<BR>
