French to accuse Hackaliah Bridges of getting her pregnant, but he was discharged; then John Fargison and Sarah, both of Ipswich, were sentenced to be whipped for &quot;uncleanness together&quot;, he was also in trouble for stealing from his master and lying. He was probably one of the Scot prisoners of Dunbar or Worcester. Both then disappear from the record. She must have died before 1680 since she was not named in her father` s will of that year, unless she had been disowned.&quot; [FFA Chart 1]</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
