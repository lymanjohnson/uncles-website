<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Misc. Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">He was only 8 years old when he removed with his parents to Michigan.  At the age of 15 he went away to school and attended for a year and a half.  At the age of 19 he commenced teaching and followed it for three years, earning the munificent sum of $25 per month.  This however was considered good wages for teaching in those days, and this young man was enabled to pay the debt which he had incurred for board while attending school,<BR>
<BR>
Our young man now decided to set up a home of his own, and he chose for his wife Catherine Garrett, the daughter of Charles E. Garrett, a native of NY.  The wedding took place 19 Aug 1861, in Highland Township.  Mr. Garrett was a ship carpenter, and had been quite a roamer.  He was married in the Buckeye State to Seraphina Higgins, and one child was born unto them, who afterward became the wife of our subject<BR>
<BR>
To Mr. Johnson and estimable wife have been born five children, one of whom died in infancy, and the four others are now living.  They are by name, Ada, who is now Mrs. Frank Fisher, and resides in Highland Township; Charles L., who resides at home and manages his father's business; Leanord, Jr., who resides at hom and works in his father's store; and Maud C., still a school girl.  Mr Johnson's farm imbraces one hundred and twenty-two broad productive acres. He followed farming until 1881, when his health necessitated his going to Florida. He took his family with him, and was gone for two years.  There he bought land and set out an orange groove, which he still owns. In 1886 he returned to Highland, where he has since lived. He then bought fifty acres including most of what is now the village of Clyde. He engaged in the livery business, which he still follows. The following year he inaugurated a mercantile business, which he has carried to success.  His wife was snatched from his side by death, Jan 12, 1889. His health has been poor ever since her decease, but he still attends to business, although within the past year he has given the matter over more into the hands of his sons. Mr. Johnson is a Republican, and always has been. He has been Township Treasurer one term, and filled the responsible position of Justice of the Peace for eight years. He is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, Clyde Lodge Nol 229. Both he and his excellent wife were identified with the Baptist Church.  Charles L. took to wife Miss Myra Wood, daughter of Rev. Alva B. &amp; Ervilla (Hollister) Wood. This important event took place at the home of Leonard S. Johnson, in Clyde, May 20, 1891.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Johnson organized the Clyde Cornet Band, and was its leader for eight years, and when his health failed his son Charles L. stepped into his father's shoes, and has filled the place with credit up to the present.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C506">506</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
