<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Misc. Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">Isaac Cummings came from England to this country in October, 1635.&nbsp; The first mention of his name in Essex County records is an entry made by the town clerk of Watertown as receiving a grant of 35 acres in the earliest general land grants in 1636 called the &quot;Great Dividends&quot;.&nbsp; Also, a record exists made by the Town Clerk of Ipswich, showing that he owned a planting lot near Reedy marsh, in that town, previous to July 25, 1638. <BR>
<BR>
On the 9th of the second month (April) of 1639, he also owned a house lot in Ipswich village on the street called the East End, next to the lot owned by Rev. Nathaniel Rogers.&nbsp; He was a commoner in 1639, and the same year sold 7 acres of land near the highway leading to Jeffrey's Neck to Andrew Hodges.&nbsp; He also possessed, in 1639, land adjoining John Winthrop and William Goodhue, the farm being partlly in Ipswich and partly in Topsfield.&nbsp; He was a proprietor in Watertown in 1642, and at Topsfield afterward, where he was one of 30 commoners. <BR>
<BR>
As an Ipswich commoner he was one of those &quot;that have the right of commonage there the last of the last month (Feb), 1641&quot;, and was made a freeman in Watertown May 18, 1642. On the first day of the second month (April), 1652, Isaac Cummings, for 30 pounds, bought of Samuel Symonds, 150 acres of land, &quot;being the North-east corner of his farm called Ollivers&quot;.&nbsp; This lot of land was in Topsfield and bounded on the west and north-west by land lately of John Winthrop, on the south and west by land of Francis Peabody, and on the south by land of Daniel Clark. <BR>
<BR>
The farm began at what is known as the Hobbs-Bell place, and continued down both sides of the brook, then called &quot;Winthropps&quot;, to what is now called Howlett's brook, one hundred acres lying on the westerly side and fifty acres on the easterly side, probably joining other land belonging to him. <BR>
<BR>
There are several court records of him: <BR>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Goodman Isaac Cummings of Topsfield, having claimed ownership of a heifer in the possession of John Fuller and driven same to his home&quot; had suit brought against him, March 28, 1654. <BR>
2)&nbsp; Isaac Comings, senior was witness against Wm. Duglas, March 1656. <BR>
3)&nbsp; Isaac Commins, senior was sued for debt by Zerobabell Phillips of Ipswich March 1657 <BR>
4)&nbsp; Isaac Cufmings, senior brought suit against John Fuller for damage done in his corn by swine belonging to said Fuller, Dec. 31, 1656. <BR>
<BR>
In 1666 he was constable, and his son Isaac was his deputy, and in a deposition he made in March, 1666, he states his age to be 65.&nbsp; The same year he was assed 4 s. 7d. to pay the town's indebtedness.&nbsp; He was deason of the church for many years and was chosen grandjuryman in 1675.&nbsp; He was a moderator of the Town meeting in 1676.&nbsp; His estate was valued at about 166 pounds.&nbsp; No trace of his wife's family name is found.&nbsp; She was not living at the time of his will.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C427">427</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
According to the CUMMINGS GENEALOGY, Ann was the fourth child of Issac. The first Essex County record has him in Watertown in 1636, where his name appears in the records of land grants, as receiving a grant of 35 acres. According to the CUMMINGS MEMORIAL Ann was the fourth child, but the birth dates of the children are listed as 1630 (John), ca 1633 (Issac), ca 1629 (Ann) and _____ (Elizabeth), which would make Ann the first child.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C302">302</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Will</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">Isaac's will was dated May 8, 1677 (8th of 3rd month), an inventory was filed 22 Maye 1677, and his will was probated June 14, 1677.&nbsp; The Title of the will was &quot;The Last Will and Testament of Isaac COMINS, senier&quot;.&nbsp; It was signed as Isaac Cumings, Sr. <BR>
