On 29 May 1655 John was included in a list drawn up of men who engaged themselves to contribute toward &quot;the building of a place of publick meetings&quot; in Sandwich. In February 1657-8 Leftenant Ellis was indebted to the town 14s. 8d. and he was appointed &quot;to build and carry on work for thge Meeting House, the which he the said Ellis accepted of.&quot; On 2 March following Pete Gaunt, Daniel Winge, Ralph Allen, Jr., and William Allen were summoned before the Court &quot;to Answer for a tumultuous carriage att a meeting of the Quakers at Sandwich.&quot; They were admonished and fined 20s. each, but upon examination at the same time &quot;Leift.

On 11 Aug 1670 an Indian called William complained &quot;that the oxen of Lieuft. Ellis&quot; had broken into his corn at Break Heart. Hill. Elisha Hedge confirmed the damage. At a town meeting 26 Aug 1674 there were given &quot;unto Fieftenant Joh Ellis twenty akers of land beginning at his cow yard at the Western side of his fence going down to the beach, the hie way excepted, or another hie way as convenient as the old... is. and Job Bourn and Thomas Tupper are chosen to lay out the land.&quot;<BR>

John Ellis should make provision for the inhabitants to come to safety into the garrison on Town Neck in times of danger.<BR>
<BR>
There are no records to indicate whether John was killied in the war, but his widow Elizabeth (Freeman) Ellis left the comparative safety and comfort of Sandwich at the age of nearly sixty, to pioneer in the settlement of Sepican. This land was a part of the grant made by the general court to veterans of King Philip's war.<BR>
<BR>
At any rate Lt. John Ellis was dead before 23 March 1676-7, when his widow presented to the probate court an inventory (not including real estate) valued at £46. 11s.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
