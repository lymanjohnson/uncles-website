Kent, being one of an old fam. at Tenterden, near Cranbrook, in that shire, bring. w. Lydia, seven ch. and seven serv.  He may have visit. our country before and went home to bring his household; but it does not appear by any facts.  In May 1637, with his friend Hatherly, he was appoint. by Plymouth Col. to sett. the bounds betw. it and Mass. He was rul. elder in the ch. and died 1641, the inv. being of 31 July, and his will of 25 May preced. in that year.  It names his wife Lydia, perhaps d. of Thomas Bourne of Marshfield, yet married in Eng. to wh. he gives his ho. at Tenterden, all the seven ch. Joseph; Thomas, born about 1621; Mary, the w. of Thomas Lapham, married 13 Mar 1637; Sarah, the w. of George Sutton; Judith; Lydia; and Stephen; also two serv. wh. should serve his eldest son, Judith married Abraham Preble, and Lydia married Richard Garrett.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C197">197, v4p301</A></SUP><BR>

&quot;Elder Nathaniel Tilden came from Tenterden in Kent, with his family, before 1628. He was chosen Ruling Elder of the first Church in Scituate 1634. His house lot was on Kent-street, the 3d. south of Greenfield lane. He had also lands at Long marsh: and lands also in 1640, on the east side of the North River, below Gravelly beach.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C577">577</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Nathaniel arrived in New England in 1634 in the ship Hercules, of Dover, with his wife and children (Joseph, Mary, Sarah, Judith, Lydia, Stephen, and Thomas), and the following, who came under the designation of 'servants:' Thomas Lapham, George Sutton, Edward Ford, Edward Jenkins, James Bennett, Sarah Couchman, and Mary Perien. The Rev. William Witherell came on this same boat.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nathaniel Tilden was among the earliest of the 'Men of Kent' who established plantations at Satuit before 1628, others being Anthony Annable, Thomas Bird, Edward Foster, William Gillson, Henry Merritt, Henry Rowley, Nathaniel Tilden, and Deane says, 'perhaps others.'&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Nathaniel was a Magistrate in Tenterden, and elected to the office of Mayor.<BR>

&quot;Elder Nath'l Tilden was the ancestor of nearly all the Tildens in Marshfield. He was one of three borothers, and they were called 'Men of Kent,' from ENgland. He came to Scitaute at that portion called 'Tow Mile' tract, now known as North Marshfield, in 1628. His farm extended both sides of North River, part of it being on 'Gravelly beach.'&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C579">579</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Spouses</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
