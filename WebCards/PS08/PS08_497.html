II&#167;ÝBENEDICT, Providence 1636, eldest son of William the first, born in England 21 Dec 1615, perhaps in Co. Nottingham, married Damalies, daughter of Stukely Wescott, had Godsgift; Josiah; Benedict, born as tradition tells, in 1641; Freelove; Oliver; and Caleb; beside other daughters, Damaris, Priscilla, and perhaps Penelope; was the richest man in the Colony, and by thorough acquaintance with the manners as well as language of the aboriginal, became the most effective auxiliary in all negotiations with them. In 1653 he removed to Newport, was chosen Assistant next year, and in 1663 made by the royal charter, President, and by annual election so continued for eight years, and died 1678. His will of 24 Dec 1677, with codicil of 10 June following, was proved 1 July. Both Godsgift, and Freelove, are by different authors made to marry Edward Pelham, and, possibly he had the two; Penelope is said to have married Roger Goulding; and Damaris married John Bliss.

Historical Collection II. 51, and III. 294; Callender; Winthrop and Knowles.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.html#C197">197, v1p64</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
